Guerrilla War is an arcade run and gun single-player/cooperative game released in 1987 in Japan named Guevara and released the same year in the US called Guerrilla War. It has five vertical scrolling levels, with a lot of enemies and vehicles and a boss at the end of each level that you will ned to defeat in order to go to the next level. At every new level, the difficulty increases a little and in the end, you have to defeat a final boss.

The objective of the game is to defeat the tyranny of the king of the island (based in the Batista regime in Cuba), to do that you take paper as Che Guevara if you are player one or as Fidel Castro if you are player two and together you will have to take down the king.
